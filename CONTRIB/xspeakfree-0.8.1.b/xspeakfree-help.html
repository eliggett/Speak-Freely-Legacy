<B>xspeakfree is a Tcl/Tk (wish) frontend to Speak Freely</B>.<P>

For more information about Speak Freely see:
	<LI><A HREF="http://www.fourmilab.ch/">http://www.fourmilab.ch/</A><BR><p>

For more information about Tcl/Tk see:
	<LI><A HREF="http://www.scriptics.com/">http://www.scriptics.com/</A><BR><P>

I am not the author of either of these packages.<P>

I recommend version 8.0 of both Tcl and Tk, however there is little
reason an older version shouldn't work.<P>

<B>Requirements:</B><P>
<PRE>
	wish (Tcl/Tk), suggested version 8.0p2
	sfspeaker and sfmike, suggestion version 6.1c
	mkfifo (your kernel must support fifos)
	/tmp must be writable by the user using xspeakfree
</PRE>

	xspeakfree is also available as a NetBSD package, thanks to
	the efforts of <a href="mailto:lamj@stat.cmu.edu">
	Johnny C. Lam" &lt;lamj@stat.cmu.edu&gt;.</a>.
	For more information on the package, see:
		<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/net/xspeakfree/README.html">

		</a>
	<P>

<B>Using xspeakfree:</B><P>

	There is no online help as its very simple and similiar to 
	the Windows version of Speak Freely.  If you have a problem
	using the program, email me and I will try to be of assitance.
	<P>

	xspeakfree executes a file on startup, its called
	".xspeakfree.rc" in your HOME directory.  This file is NOT a
	shell script, its a Tcl script source'd in though the Tcl
	interpreter.
	<P>
	
	To connect to a remote host and send audio, either go to
	connection and select "New" and type in the host name, or
	click on their name in the Target Host list with Button-3
	(right mouse button) and select "Connect to host".
	This will cause any current sfmike to exit and a new one to
	start with the current settings sending audio to the newly
	selected host.  Clicking on an already selected host name is
	a nop.
	<P>
	
	As hosts connect to your sfspeaker, they will be added to the
	host list automatically.  As hosts disconnect, they will not be
	removed from the list.  This is a change from its previous
	behavior of removing a host from the list after a disconnect.
	<P>

	Check out the Options menu.  It should be self explanatory.
	If its not, let me know.
<P>
	
<B>OS Features:</B><P>

	If you are on an SGI, you will note there is an "Irix" menu on
	the menubar.  Any other OS this should be omitted.<P>

	The only special support for Irix right now is launching the
	Audio Panel directly from xspeakfree.  I'd like to add more
	support than that, especially for ther OS's.<P>

	If people can send me what options they want for what OS, as
	well as the output of just "uname" for their OS - or some
	other method of dertermining from a shell the OS type, as well
	as how to do the options (ie I have NO CLUE how to control
	volume on a Sparc Station so you have to tell me) I'll 
	try to add in the support for that OS.<P>

<B>.xspeakfree.rc file:</B><P>

	This file is executed right before the window appears, after
	all defaults have been programmed.  This way you can override
	any default settings, configure your audio hardware, etc.<P>

	In order to execute a shell command, simply prefix the line
	with a "exec", ie on my SGI my .xspeakfree.rc file has this line
	in it to configure my input port for the microphone:<P>

	exec apanel -nodisplay -nofork -defaultout AnalogOut2 -device
	AnalogOut2 -gain 7.5 -rate 8000 -unmute<P>

	This has the effect of running the program apanel with that
	mess of arguments.  =)<P>

	I'm not going to help you with Tcl, go look on the web, there
	are plenty of online manpages there.  But here's a list of the
	variables you can modify and what effect they will have:<P>
	
	All defaults for these variables are the normal Speak Freely
	software defaults.  =)<P>

	<TABLE border="1">
	<TR><TD>Speaker(port)</TD><TD>default port for sfspeaker to listen on</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD>Speaker(args:jitter)</TD><TD>jitter setting, must be the full
		commandline value, ie "-J2000" for 2 seconds.</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD>Speaker(args:disable_remote_ring)</TD><TD>set to "-n" to disable
		remote ring, " " to turn this feature off.</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD>Speaker(:record:onoff)</TD><TD>set to 1 to record audio,
		0 to not.  default is 0.</TD></TR>
	
	<TR><TD>Speaker(:record:file)</TD><TD>set to the file path to store
		recorded audio in.  ignored unless Speaker(:record:onoff)
		is set to 1.</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD>Speaker(:record:append)</TD><TD>set to "+" to append to record files
		instead of overwriting.  set to "" to overwrite.</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD>Speaker(args:user)</TD><TD>additonal arguments for sfspeaker</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD>Speaker(:crypt:method)</TD><TD>set to " " to use none,
		"-O" for file, "-I" for IDEA, "-K" for DES
		and "-Z" for PGP pass phrase.</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD>Speaker(:crypt:-I)</TD><TD>IDEA string</TD></TR>
	<TR><TD>Speaker(:crypt:-K)</TD><TD>DES string</TD></TR>
	<TR><TD>Speaker(:crypt:-Z)</TD><TD>PGP pass phrase</TD></TR>
	<TR><TD>Speaker(:crypt:-O)</TD><TD>File path</TD></TR>
	
	<TR><TD>Mike(args:simplecompression)</TD><TD>set to "-C" to turn on simple
		compression, set to " " to turn it off.  Yes, its off
		value is a space.</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD>Mike(args:compression)</TD><TD>set to "-N" to turn off all
		compression, set to the appropiate sfmike argument for
		that compression setting.  ie "-T" will turn on GSM,
		-LPC10R1 will set up LPC10, one copy.  Default is GSM</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD>Mike(args:protocol)</TD><TD>set to " " for Speak Freely protocol,
		otherwise set to the sfmike argument for the protocl
		you want.</TD></TR>

	<TR><TD>Mike(args:user)</TD><TD>additional arguments for sfmike, provided
		just in case.</TD></TR>
	</TABLE><P>

	To set one of these variables, you can use the following
	syntax:<P>

	<PRE>
		set <variable name> "new value"
	</PRE>

	ie:

	<PRE>
		set Mike(args:compression) "-LPC"
	</PRE>

	to set the default compression as LPC.<P>
	
	LWL information is taken from the environment variables:<P>

		<TABLE BORDER="1">
		<TR><TD>SPEAKFREE_LWL_TELL</TD><TD>comma seperated list of
			hosts</TD></TR>
		<TR><TD>SPEAKFREE_ID</TD><TD>information of the format of:
			"fullname:email:phone:location"</TD></TR>
		</TABLE><P>

<B>.xspeakfree.hostlist</B><P>
	
	This file is parsed at startup, it is NOT a Tcl file, rather a
	plain text file containg two types of lines:  comments and
	hostnames.  comment lines begin with a '#'.  host names look
	like:<P>

	<PRE>
	hostname	comment
	</PRE>

	these hostnames are loaded into the target host list at
	startup and the comment field is placed in parens next to the
	name.  ie a line like this in .xspeakfree.hostlist:<P>

	<PRE>
	nj5.injersey.com	Shawn Pearce
	</PRE>

	becomes:<P>

	<PRE>
	nj5.injersey.com (Shawn Pearce)
	</PRE>

	in the host list.<P>
	
	This file is NOT modified by the program, it is to be modified
	by the user.  Perhaps in the future I will make it modifiable
	through the program.<P>

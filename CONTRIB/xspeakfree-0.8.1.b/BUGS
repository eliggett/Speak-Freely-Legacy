Bugs:
	There aren't any, everything you see is
	a "feature".

	Requires the use of one or more FIFOs for each and every
	single process spawned.

	Cannot catch Unix signals (HUP, TERM, etc) in Tcl so /bin/sh
	hack is currently in use.  The /bin/sh hack is annoying but
	it works and there is really no problem with it.

	Randomly when you edit your LWL information sfspeaker will
	shutdown and sometimes refuses to restart.  Anyone shed some
	light on this one?

xspeakfree is a Tcl/Tk (wish) frontend to Speak Freely.

Installing should be pretty easy.  Install at least sfspeaker
and sfmike into a directory in your execution search path
(environment variable PATH).

Make sure you have wish (Tcl/Tk) installed in your search path as
well.  If you don't have Tcl/Tk, its freely available from Sun at:
	
	http://www.scriptics.com/

xspeakfree can be run directly out of this directory, but if you wish
to have xspeakfree stored in /usr/local/bin or some other place it is
easier to use install.sh than playing around with things to make it
work.  So you have two options:

	1) Place this directory somplace and run xspeakfree from it.
	2) install xspeakfree into someplace like /usr/local/bin

For option one, to run xpseakfree run:
	<this directory>/bin/xspeakfree

and your off.

For option two, make sure you can write to the directory you wish to
install into.  I recommend /usr/local, but its up to you.

To install xspeakfree, simply run install.sh by typing this command
line:

	./install.sh <install path>

<install path> should be the directory you want to install xspeakfree.
ie:

	./install.sh /usr/local

then just run xspeakfree:

	<install path>/bin/xspeakfree

or simply 

	xspeakfree

if it is now in your search path.

							
Release Version 3.2 (PC release) 

This responds to your request for our 4800 bps Code Excited Linear Predictive
(CELP) voice coder (version 3.2) that complies with Federal Standard
1016 [1].  Restrictions on this package and its contents are described below.

This release is being provided on PC diskette in a DOS format (translated
from UNIX based on the command unixtodos.  The original filenames have
been truncated to DOS filename limitations, otherwise the code is exactly
the same as was used on Sun Sparcstations for the development of this code.
It is suggested that this code be run on a Sun Workstation.  If the code is
run on a PC, some changes (between UNIX and DOS formats) will be needed.  
The U.S. Government is not prepared to make these changes and will not 
support these changes.

The CELP source code contained in this release was developed by the
U.S. Government in conjunction with a contract to AT&T Bell Laboratories
Acoustics Research Department and with the help of many others cited in 
[2, 3, 4].
Except where noted, all other code included in this package was developed
strictly by and is the property of the U.S. Government.   Additional code in 
the package is provided as a courtesy to aid your development and the U.S. 
Government is under no obligation to support it.

An earlier version of the coder (1.33r) achieved the results reported in
[2] under the "Phase 3 CELP V.33 scores, December 1988".  

INSTALLATION
------------
Since this package was developed under BSD UNIX, it is highly recommended
that it be installed on a machine supporting the BSD UNIX environment
(e.g., Sun, Alliant, or Convex).  For installation of specific programs,
follow the directions in README files located in the directories listed
below.

CONTENTS
--------
This release subdirectory structure is described below.  Please refer
to README files in these directories for further information.  (Note,
celp3_2 and celp3_2c are only programs and are not to be confused with the 
actual Federal Standard 1016!)

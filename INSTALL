To build and install Speak Freely for Unix, edit the Makefile
to set the C compiler and linker flags and any options appropriately
for your system.  Settings for a variety of popular platforms are
included at the top of the Makefile, and you may be able to simply
uncomment those for your system.

Next, perform a:

    make

If everything compiles and links OK, you're ready to copy the
Speak Freely executables (named on the "PROGRAMS =" line in
the Makefile) into a local binary directory on your path.
Documentation for each of these programs is supplied in
the eponymous man pages, all with an extension of ".1".
Alternatively, you can set the install program path and
target directories at the start of the Makefile and perform
a "make install"; if you wish to install in system directories,
you'll need to be super-user to run this.

You'll probably want to add appropriate settings of the
various SPEAKFREE_ environment variables in your login
profile; see the "LOOK WHO'S LISTENING" section of the
sfspeaker.1 manual page for details.

If one or more of the modules of Speak Freely fails to build
properly, double-check your compiler and linker option settings
in the Makefile.
